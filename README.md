# Courier Kata

You work for a courier company and have been tasked with creating a code library to
calculate the cost of sending an order of parcels.

## Installation

Initialise the project using Gradle

```bash
./gradlew
```

## Usage
Run tests 

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Design Principles
- Polymorphism
- Builder pattern
- TDD
- **Note:** Documentation within the code

## Evaluation
- I would have liked to explore a **Mock testing** especially for `DisctountApplier` to test connections with methods, but I have been having issues with Gradle dependencies.
